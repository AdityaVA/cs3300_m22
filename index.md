## Course Objectives

Compilers translate programs written by humans in high-level languages to
programs which can be executed by machines. They are very important, heavily
used and at the same time one of the most complex pieces of software. A whole
range of techniques and ideas from Automata Theory, Algorithm Design, Computer
Organization and Architecture, etc. are cleverly applied to create a compiler.
In this course, students will learn in depth the various phases involved in the
compilation process. The course will also involve implementing an actual
compiler for a subset of the Java language.

**Goal of the course:** At the end of the course, students will have a fair
understanding of some standard passes in a general purpose compiler. Students
will have hands on experience on implementing a compiler for a subset of Java.
