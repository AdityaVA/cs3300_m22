In this lab, we will be using
[Bison](https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/manual/bison.html), which is a parser
generator. Bison is a general-purpose parser generator that converts a grammar
description (Bison Grammar Files) for an LALR(1) context-free grammar into a C
program to parse that grammar. The Bison parser is a bottom-up parser. It tries,
by shifts and reductions, to reduce the entire input down to a single grouping
whose symbol is the grammar's start-symbol.

The slides and demo files are available in the [Github repo](https://github.com/kayceesrk/cs3300_m22/tree/main/labs/02_bison).
