## Git

You will be developing large programs with 100s of lines of code. It is a good
idea to learn and use version control system to manage your code development. My
recommendation is to [learn Git version control
system](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/about-git). Git is not
essential for the course, but learning it would serve you well in the years to
come.
